Main Page
=========

Welcome to the SimuNEX documentation. This page will help you navigate through the various sections of the Doxygen-generated documentation.

Navigating the Documentation
----------------------------

**Sidebar Navigation**

The sidebar on the left side of the page contains links to different sections of the documentation:

- **Classes**: This section lists all the classes, structures, unions, and interfaces documented in the source code. Click on any class name to view detailed information about that class, including its member functions, variables, and more.

- **Files**: Here you can find a list of all the source files used in the project. Each entry links to a page with detailed information about the file, including the documentation of all the entities defined in that file.

- **Packages**: If the codebase is organized into packages or namespaces, you will find them listed here. This is useful for getting an overview of the code's modular structure.

**Search Box**

At the top right corner of the page, there is a search box where you can search for specific terms within the documentation. This is a quick way to find information on a particular topic.

**Class Hierarchy**

The class hierarchy provides a tree view of how classes are related to each other through inheritance. This can be accessed from the sidebar under the "Classes" dropdown.

**File Members**

All the global functions, variables, defines, enums, and typedefs are listed under file members. This provides a quick reference to all the global scope entities.

**Related Pages**

This section includes any custom pages that have been added to the documentation to provide additional information that doesn't necessarily fit within the code comments.

Getting More Information
