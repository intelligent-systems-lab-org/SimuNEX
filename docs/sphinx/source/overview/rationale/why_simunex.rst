        **Risk Mitigation**

        Safe, cost-free virtual environments


Traditional tools such as MATLAB/Simulink lack the interactivity and immersion required for authenticity.
These tools offer limited visualization, meaningful feedback, as well as a standardized framework that enable the creation, integration and simulation of dynamic systems using a modular
and reusable approach. Furthermore, existing tools may not adequately address the specific requirements of different engineering domains, limiting their usage and does not truly allow for interdisciplinary collaboration.

The design objectives for SimuNEX are as follows:

.. grid:: 2 2 2 2
    :gutter: 4

    .. grid-item-card:: Realistic Visualization
         
        Visually appealing, realistic environment rendering, and dynamic effects to provide immersive experiences. 
    

    .. grid-item-card:: Enhanced Simulation

        Real-time and responsive simulation with advanced event handling, encompassing everything from environmental sounds to complex system anomalies.

 
    .. grid-item-card:: Versatility

        A cross-disciplinary simulation platform enabling engineers to collaborate, simulate, and optimize systems across various fields.

    
    .. grid-item-card:: Modularity and Reusability
        
        Offers a library of pre-built components for streamlined integration, promoting code reusability and reducing development time.

    
    .. grid-item-card:: Comprehensive Documentation

        Accessible and thorough documentation for all, ensuring transparency and ease of use for the full spectrum of simulation features.
