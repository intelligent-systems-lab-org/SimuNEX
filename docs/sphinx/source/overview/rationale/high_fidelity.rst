Call for High-Fidelity
======================

High-fidelity simulation is often a misunderstood term, what does it REALLY mean?

High-fidelity simulation is commonly incorrectly described as a simulation that has a high *level of detail*.
This means that the system being simulated (*simuland*) performs close to its real-world counterpart in terms
of its *dynamics*. Without going into detail, dynamics simply refers to the underlying mathematical equations 
that govern the system's behavior. However, this is subject to scientific theory based on our current 
understanding of the real world and while we know that some models are more *accurate* than others, we cannot
prove if a model truly describes the behavior of the real system with 100% certainty.

High level of detail is commonly the most valued aspect of simulation. However, it is NOT synonymous with high-fidelity:

    .. math:: \text{High level of detail} \neq \text{High-fidelity}

But we can say however, the high-fidelity includes level of detail:

    .. math:: \text{High level of detail} \subset \text{High-fidelity}

High-fidelity simulation captures absolutely **everything** about the real-world it is trying to simulate.
This not only includes the level of detail, but also physical characteristics, environmental cues, and cognitive engagement 
as if the user is experiencing the real thing! Let's outline each aspect of high-fidelity simulation to further cement this idea:

.. grid:: 2 2 2 2
    :gutter: 4

    .. grid-item-card:: Level of Detail
         
        - Represents the granularity and precision of the simulation's elements.
        - Includes visual accuracy, data density, and scenario complexity.
        - A subset of high-fidelity, but not the entirety of it.
    

    .. grid-item-card:: Physical Characteristics

        - Encompasses the accurate replication of the physical properties of the system.
        - Incorporates factors like material properties, ergonomics, and kinetics.
        - Ensures that physical interactions in the simulation mimic those in the real world.

 
    .. grid-item-card:: Environmental Cues

        - Refers to the sensory information that provides context for the simulation.
        - Features like audio feedback, visual warnings, haptic feedback, and collision dynamics.
        - Enhances the user's immersion and triggers deeper engagement.


    .. grid-item-card:: Cognitive Engagement

        - Involves the mental processes required to interact with the simulation.
        - Encourages critical thinking, decision-making, and problem-solving.
        - Authentic assessments are embedded to evaluate the user's understanding and adaptation.


Round Up
========

High-fidelity simulation lends itself to authenticity, emulating the real world as much as possible to maximize user engagement.
It's not just model accuracy, but also visualizations, sensory information, and requiring the user to utilize their problem-solving
skills just as much as they would in the real world. Hopefully that clears things up!
