Keeping it Real
===============

In the era of artificial intelligence, where research has been accelerating at unprecedented levels,
traditional methods of assessments have been becoming **obsolete.**

The Problem with Traditional Methods
************************************
Traditional assessments, such as pen and paper tests often fail to capture the nuances of real-world application.
They emphasize information recall, lacking the higher-order level of thinking such as complex problem solving
and 21st-century competencies such as critical thinking and collaboration. Beyond the classroom, learners are 
left unprepared for the challenges involved in their professional lives.

The Imperative of Authentic Assessments
***************************************
Enter authentic asssessments, the alternative teaching strategy used to overcome the shortcomings of traditional
assessments. Authentic assessments focus heavily on replicating real-world contexts instead of the regurgitation of
factual knowledge. This is further enhanced with the aid of technology, specifically simulation.
However, authentic assessments can be time-consuming or costly to develop and administer.


The Possibilities with AI-Enabled Learning
******************************************

We all have heard of large language models (LLMs), due to the rapid surge in popularity brought to light with the release of
ChatGPT in November 2022 by OpenAI. The recent emergence of generative AI has brought significant advancements to the educational landscape. 

Adaptive learning platforms and AI-powered tutors can personalize learning pathways and offer targeted feedback, 
improving student engagement and outcomes. However, these tools also pose new challenges. 
The ease of access to information and the potential for automation can lead to a reliance on superficial understanding 
and shortcuts, undermining the development of deeper critical thinking and problem-solving skills.
